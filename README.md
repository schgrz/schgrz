## About Me
Hi! 👋 I’m **Alex**, a graduate with a **Master of Science** in **Data Science** from the University of Connecticut and a data enthusiast. As someone who enjoys solving puzzles, I took to Data Science to scratch that itch by learning coding and applying those skills through statistical methods. Excel wasn't enough for me, so I had to take it a step further! I enjoy uncovering the patterns, building models, and visualizing insights to reveal the story behind the numbers. Whether I'm designing machine learning models, creating reproducible workflows, or streamlining processes through data-driven solutions, every project is an opportunity to solve a puzzle, improve efficiency, and turn complexity into clarity.

I work across **Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and other visualization tools**, building projects in analytics, reporting, and machine learning.
